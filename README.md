# AnalyzingKickstarterProjects

Welcome to my first SQL project! In this project, I test my abilities to extract data from a database tables using SELECT queries, filter data using WHERE clauses with operators, sort query results using ORDER BY
and transform data using SQL functions. This project is from the DataQuest educational webpage.

## Prompt

Objective: Analyze Kickstarter data using SQL to identify key factors contributing to campaign success and inform product launch decisions.

The product team is considering launching a campaign on Kickstarter to test the viability of some offerings. You've been asked to pull data that will help the team understand what might influence the success of a campaign. The data source is a [selection of fields from Kaggle.]: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects

Specifically, we'll answer the following questions:

What types of projects are most likely to be successful?
Which projects fail?
To get you started, here are the definitions of the columns in this data:

ID: Kickstarter project ID
name: Name of project
category: Category of project
main_category: Main category of project
goal: Fundraising goal
